Assignment 2

Simply run 'make' to create the threads executable. When ran, a bunch of threads
will be created and initialized followed by running of the scheduler. The scheduler
will choose a thread to run based off a lottery scheduling algorithm which will
call the function associated with the program. This function will derement a work
counter until a timer goes off and the scheduler is called again or there's no more work
for that thread to do which will cause it to be deleted. Once all work has been done by
all the threads the program will exit.
