Assignment 4

This was written on OS X, but it should work on linux as well. The headers and makefile
check what system they're on and conditionally include and link based on that. The
executable included was compiled on x86 ubuntu 12.04 with all libraries and headers
installed to /usr/.

Holding the right mouse button and moving forward/back will zoom the
camera in and out. Holding the left mouse button and moving it around
will pan the camera. The look around button will rotate the camera 360
degrees around the y axis of the world. The orbit button will orbit the
camera around the selected model by 360 degrees. If no model is selected
it will do nothing.
