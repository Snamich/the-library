Lab 5

I wrote this on OS X, but it should work on linux as well. The headers and makefile
check what system they're on and conditionally include and link based on that. The
executable included was compiled on x86 ubuntu 12.04 with all libraries and headers
installed to /usr/.

I don't think it's working right, but I can't work on it anymore. I'm pretty sure
the geometry is set up correctly, but I can't tell because the camera doesn't seem
to be set up correctly so I can view the whole model.
