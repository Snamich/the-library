<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This project aims to create a create a basic ray tracer
that can simulate the effects of reflection and refraction
on basic geometric objects. In nature, light travels in rays
that interact with surfaces by absorption, refraction, and
reflectio and when these rays enter our eyes the interaction
with surfaces determines the image of the scene. A ray tracer
captures this interaction by simulating the rays and following
them around the scene. When an interaction occurs, new rays
are recursively created and followed to find out information
such as the amount of reflection, refraction, and shadow. This
makes it much simpler to compute this information compared to
a typical scanline renderer and creates much more realistic
images.</p>

<h3>Goals (Components and Features)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Geometric Objects.</li>
<li>Scene Objects.</li>
<li>Ray Tracing Algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first thing to do is to create an interface for the
geometric objects that will be implemented. These will include
spheres, planes, triangles/meshes. An object oriented approach
will be used that provides an interface standard to each object.</p>

<p>Next the scene objects need to be created which will include
objects such as lights and cameras. Additionally an acceleration
structure will be implemented in order to facilitate fast ray hit
detection.</p>

<p>The last component will be implementing the ray tracing
algorithm. This will involve creating the ray objects that will
be cast out into the scene (normal rays, shadow rays), samplers
to contain the relevant information obtained on a ray cast, and
implementing the recursive ray tracing algorithm so that shadow,
refraction, and reflection rays can be recast on surface
collisions.</p>
