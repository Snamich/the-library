Final Project Ideas

Ranked in order of preference.

1) ray tracer with materials, samplers, acceleration structures, etc.

2) some kind of cross platform 2d rendering engine with sprites, tile maps, etc.
Not sure how this would rank on scale of difficulty.

3) 3d mazes. Represent maps using some kind data format, load them in, create a first person camera that represents the player while they try to find their way out.
