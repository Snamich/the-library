<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This project aims to create a create a basic ray tracer
that can simulate the effects of reflection and refraction
on basic geometric objects. In nature, light travels in rays
that interact with surfaces by absorption, refraction, and
reflectio and when these rays enter our eyes the interaction
with surfaces determines the image of the scene. A ray tracer
captures this interaction by simulating the rays and following
them around the scene. When an interaction occurs, new rays
are recursively created and followed to find out information
such as the amount of reflection, refraction, and shadow. This
makes it much simpler to compute this information compared to
a typical scanline renderer and creates much more realistic
images.</p>

<h3>Manual</h3>

<p>Once all the code is loaded a few things must be set up before rendering a scene.
The global variable *vp* must be set up as an instance of the view plane class. Once
this object has been created its sampler points must be generated.</p>

<p>Next our camera must be created and initialized. This is done by setting its eye and
lookat positions as well as the distance from the eye to the viewplane. After that
its uvw axes can be generated and the camera is now set up.</p>

<p>Following that we can now add different scene objects to scene such as an ambient
light, point or directional lights, as well as the geometric objects of our scene. Once
our scene is created we can render it with the following command:</p>

<p>(render-scene *camera* pathname) where pathname is the path to the file we wish
to render the image as such as "~/". The image will be drawn to that specified file
and it's done. (reset-scene) can be called to remove all lights and geometric objects
so you can render another scene.</p>

<p>Example scenes can be found in the build directory of the project.</p>
